# KidCoding-PHP
A simple PHP tutorial for small kids, aim for talented 6 years old or older

# INTRO
Its not easy to find a coding material for kids already has programing concept but yet fully understand reading. My son started learning programing since he was 4.5 years old, he went thru whole set of Lego boost, has concept of random, functions, nested loops and variable. Most people may let kids learn Scratch at this age, but for him its way too easy, after an hour of BASH on my Mac, using simple regex and echo to do simple add and subtract. i quickly see how much learning protential he has. But sadly after months of searching and can't find the right lessions, Swift playground is too hard and actually boring.

# GOAL
The main gola of this tutorial is to create simple self-learning classes for him. Small games and stuffs like simple calculator, simple ChatBot, etc. Hopefully he can learn by himself... and may need a little guidiance from experienced adult, but still make it fun and interesting while using actual programing language. Using PHP provide simple syntax, flexible but yet powerful and has great protential for system script and web developing. And having the code deployed on a simple LAMP would let kids able to show his work any where to any one. 

# Codes idea
* Hello World - first program to display kid's name with random color, and play with HEX color code
* What time is it - Just a simple page to display time

* AddCalculator - a calculator just to do add 
* SimpleCalculator - a simple calculator allow user to do add/subtract/multiply/divice 
* SmartSimpleCalculator - based on SimpleCalculator,  add error checking to make sure input are integers, and return error code

* EmojiSearcher - search emoji by string, non-casesensitive, return list of emoji on screen
* EmojiSerialSearcher - input a list of string, and search emoji from list or display a random emojoy. its random fun! 

* SillyChatbot - With an list of question, ask the kids, and reorganize the answer and display
